# Data Representation and Querying Project Eliza-ChatBot
My name is Edward Eldridge I am a third year software developement student in G.M.I.T.

The following program is an Eliza Chatbot with a personality akin to the Hal9000 AI from the Stanley Kubrick film '2001: A Space Odyssey' (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062622/)

The project is based on criteria outlined at (https://data-representation.github.io/problems/project.html)

#### What is an Eliza Chatbot
ELIZA is an early natural language processing computer program created from 1964 to 1966[1] at the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Joseph Weizenbaum.[2] Created to demonstrate the superficiality of communication between man and machine, Eliza simulated conversation by using a 'pattern matching' and substitution methodology that gave users an illusion of understanding on the part of the program, but had no built in framework for contextualizing events.[3] Directives on how to interact were provided by 'scripts', written originally in MAD-Slip, which allowed ELIZA to process user inputs and engage in discourse following the rules and directions of the script. The most famous script, DOCTOR, simulated a Rogerian psychotherapist and used rules, dictated in the script, to respond with non-directional questions to user inputs. As such, ELIZA was one of the first chatterbots, but was also regarded as one of the first programs capable of passing the Turing Test. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA)

#### How to run the program
This program uses the Go programming language .

If you do not currently have Go installed click on the following link to download [INSTALL GO](https://golang.org/dl/)

To clone the repository to your local machine, in command prompt enter 
```
git clone https://github.com/kbarry91/Eliza-ChatBot.git
```
There is two ways to run this program
1. **Build and Run** Navigate to the Eliza-Chatbot folder and enter the following to compile the code 
```
go build chatbot.go
```
This will create a .exe file in your current directory.To launch the server and run the file 
```
chatbot
```
2. **Run** to simply run the program in your command prompt enter the following 
```
go run chatbot.go
```  
The webpage will now be served to the local host. To view the homepage ,open you browser and enter to the local address
```
127.0.0.1:8080
```
Or alternatively you can enter
```
localhost:8080
```
